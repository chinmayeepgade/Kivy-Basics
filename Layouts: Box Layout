    #(width,height) size_hint is a proportional property which has can be used independently or along with the size parameter and can have a value None(if used along with size) or decimal between 0 to 1 (size cannot be specified without specifying size_hint)
        pos_hint: {"center_x":0.5}
    #The pos_hint (position proportion) is to be specified as in the form of a dictionary; the keys of the key value pairs being: for horizontal: "x"/"center_x"/"right" for vertical: "y"/"center_y"/"top" and the values being decimals between 0 to 1
    # A layout can be embedded inside a Layout:
    BoxLayout:
        size_hint: 0.5,0.5
        pos_hint: {"center_x":0.5}
        orientation: "horizontal"
        Button
            text: "B1"
        Button:
            text: "B2"
        Button:
            text: "B3"
    Button:
        text: "C"
        size_hint: 0.5,0.2
        pos_hint: {"center_x":0.5}
